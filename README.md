## 📖 Overview

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a numerical statistic used to reflect the importance of a term in a document relative to a collection (or corpus) of documents. It is widely used in information retrieval and text mining. 

This library is a hobby project aimed at understanding the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It's designed to only provide basic functionality, so optimizations are for the user to implement.

## ⚙️ Features

- **TF-IDF Calculation**: Easily compute TF-IDF scores for documents.
- **Modular Design**: Easily integrate with text processing libraries.
- **Customization**: Supports various weighting schemes for TF and IDF.
  
## 🚀 Installation

## 🛠️ Usage

## 🔮 Future Plans

If I feel like working on it some more, it will probably be on:

- **Caching**: Implement caching to avoid recalculating scores.
- **Incremental Updates**: Allow users to update the corpus without recalculating everything.
- **Data Export**: Add functionality to export computed scores for further analysis.
